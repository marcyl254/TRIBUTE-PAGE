          <h4>Early life and Education</h4>
          <hr />
          <p>
            Matthew Langford Perry was born in Williamstown, Massachusetts, on
            August 19, 1969.His mother, Suzanne Marie Morrison (née Langford,
            born 1948),is a Canadian journalist who was press secretary to
            Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau. His father, John Bennett
            Perry (born 1941), is an American actor and former model.
            <br />
            When he was one year old,Perry's parents seperated and his mother
            married Canadian broadcast journalist Keith Morrison. He was raised
            by his mother mostly in Ottawa, Ontario, but he also lived briefly
            in Toronto and Montreal.Perry attended Rockcliffe Park Public School
            and Ashbury College, a boarding school in Ottawa.He had four younger
            maternal half-siblings—Caitlin, Emily, Will, and Madeline—as well as
            a younger paternal half-sister named Maria.
            <br /><br />
            Perry grew to become a troublesome child at only ten years. He would
            be caught stealing money,smoking and once beat up fellow student and
            future Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau.He later attributed
            this to feeling like a family outsider who did not belong,writing"I
            was so often on the outside looking in, still that kid up in the
            clouds on a flight to somewhere else, unaccompanied." Perry faced
            personal challenges with regards to his academics as he struggled
            with dyslexia, a learning disability that made traditional education
            methods challenging.At 15 years old, Perry studied acting at Buckley
            School, a college-preparatory school in Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles,
            and graduated in 1987.While in high school, he took improvisational
            comedy classes at L.A. Connection in Sherman Oaks.
            <br /><br />
            Perry's mother encouraged him to participate in regional theater,a
            decision which proved pivotal, as it not only honed his actring
            skills but also provided a practical outlet for his creative
            energy.Perry's involvement in theater productions during his
            formative years laid the ground work for his future success in the
            entertainment industry.Deciding to pursue his acting aspirations
            more seriously,he enrolled at the University of Southern
            California's School of Theater,Film and Television.

            Matthew Perry's early life and education shaped not only his
